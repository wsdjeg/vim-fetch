" Based on |BufNewFile|, but flanked by |BufWinEnter| to correctly process all
" buffers in an |arglist| passed with '-o/-O' resp. '-p' (see
" |windows-starting| for some background, though that omits to mention that
" |BufRead| events are also skipped, as is |BufNewFile|, that |BufWinEnter|
" events *are* fired for all buffers, and relies on implicitly understanding
" that the first buffer of the list is activated after loading all files, but
" that the usual event sequence still is out of kilter; also note there is no
" equivalent help section for '-p' though its behaviour is analogous).
"
" Note the use of highly spec specific file name patterns to avoid autocommand
" flooding when nesting (which is needed as we switch buffers out).
